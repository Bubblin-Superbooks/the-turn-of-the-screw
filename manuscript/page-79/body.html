I saw him as I see you.”</p><p>“Then how did he get in?”</p><p>“And how did he get out?” I laughed. “I had no opportunity to ask him! This evening, you see,” I pursued, “he has not been able to get in.”</p><p>“He only peeps?”</p><p>“I hope it will be confined to that!” She had now let go my hand; she turned away a little. I waited an instant; then I brought out: “Go to church. Goodbye. I must watch.”</p><p>Slowly she faced me again. “Do you fear for them?”</p><p>We met in another long look. “Don’t _you?_” Instead of answering she came nearer to the window and, for a minute, applied her face to the glass. “You see how he could see,” I meanwhile went on.</p><p>She didn’t move. “How long was he here?”</p><p>“Till I came out. I came to meet him.”</p></div> </div>
