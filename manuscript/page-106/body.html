By the way she looked.”</p><p>“At you, do you mean—so wickedly?”</p><p>“Dear me, no—I could have borne that. She gave me never a glance. She only fixed the child.”</p><p>Mrs. Grose tried to see it. “Fixed her?”</p><p>“Ah, with such awful eyes!”</p><p>She stared at mine as if they might really have resembled them. “Do you mean of dislike?”</p><p>“God help us, no. Of something much worse.”</p><p>“Worse than dislike?”—this left her indeed at a loss.</p><p>“With a determination—indescribable. With a kind of fury of intention.”</p><p>I made her turn pale. “Intention?”</p><p>“To get hold of her.” Mrs. Grose—her eyes just lingering on mine—gave a shudder and walked to the window; and while she stood there looking out I completed my statement. “<em>That’s</em> what Flora knows.”</p></div> </div>
